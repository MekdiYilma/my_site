          <p>
            I grew up in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and came to the United States to further my education
            in finance. I studied at Dominican University, graduating summa cum laude, and then
            secured an internship in the competitive investment banking industry. Over the next few
            years, I honed my data analysis and reporting skills as a business strategy analyst to
            help drive growth within the SaaS companies I worked for. However, my passion for
            mathematics led me to enroll in a part-time bootcamp to become a data scientist.
            Currently, I use complex data to derive insightful business recommendations in my role
            as a data scientist. My next adventure is to become a software developer and pursue my
            entrepreneurial aspirations.
